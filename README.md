# ENVS-193DS_homework-05_Zamora-Riley

## About
This homework tackles the questions, how can some independent varaibles predict the toal mass of each plant?, what variables are the best for predicting?, what methods shoukd be used in model selection?, and how does a chosen model perform in prediction? 

We will be using multiple regression and other statistical methods taught in this course. We will use knowlegde of the environment as well as what is given to us through the data and metadata.

## Data
We are looking at some plant data that is found at https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-hfr.109.18 This data set contains plant data and is the basis of this projcet. I recommend checking out the linked website and reading more about the data.
